      'This paper is based on a controlled experiment using sensors, and replicating observed street conditions for people experiencing in the City of Phoenix during the sweltering summer. The study tested the efficiency of different tent covers such as a white bedsheet, mylar, tarp, and aluminum foil, and determined differences in air temperature and the mean radiant temperature inside the different tent cover shadings. In addition, the study applied different statistical and physiological modeling techniques to ascertain whether significant differences in air temperature, mean radiant temperature and core temperature varied across different shading types. Generally, tent covers offer protection during the day, but exacerbate nighttime thermal discomfort in the tents. To read more, see the following link: ',

      'This paper is similar in research design to study 1 above, although it only focused on air temperature differences inside the different types of tent shades. In addition, the experimental designs were slightly different (i.e., in this paper, the tent shadings covered the top and the sides of the tents while in research 1 the tent shades only covered the top). The study established that allowing for air circulation/mixing is critical in reducing in-tent air temperature. At the same, time, the tarp material, which is the most common tent shade type in the City of Phoenix by the people experiencing homelessness, had the highest air temperature.

      'This research paper compares raster and vector models in representing social vulnerability in Atlanta Georgia across multiple time stamps (2000-2019). At the same time, the research compares different weighting mechanisms (equal weighting and variance-based weighting of variables and principal components, respectively). Findings indicated the influences of different scales on measures of spatial autocorrelation, confirming the variations of outputs, given varied scale choices. Therefore, combining multiple methods of deriving the social vulnerability index (e.g., weighting techniques and GIScience model type) altered the magnitude and intensity of the index.

      'This review paper summarizes the vulnerability literature and discusses the multiple challenges when representing spatial vulnerability to heat. Common methodological challenges vary in the data structural design (e.g., variable addition or reduction), normalization method (e.g., area vs population-based), and GIScience model (e.g., raster vs vector designs), among others. The review builds on these research gaps and proposes a few solutions, anchored on a longitudinal study design. To read more, follow this link: ',
