The study tested the efficiency of different tent covers such as a white bedsheet, mylar, tarp, and aluminum foil, and determined differences in air temperature and the mean radiant temperature inside the different tent cover shadings. In addition, the study applied different statistical and physiological modeling techniques to ascertain whether significant differences in air temperature, mean radiant temperature and core temperature varied across different shading types. Generally, tent covers offer protection during the day, but exacerbate nighttime thermal discomfort in the tents.

In addition, the experimental designs were slightly different (i.e., in this paper, the tent shadings covered the top and the sides of the tents while in research 1 the tent shades only covered the top). The study established that allowing for air circulation/mixing is critical in reducing in-tent air temperature. At the same, time, the tarp material, which is the most common tent shade type in the City of Phoenix by the people experiencing homelessness, had the highest air temperature.

Therefore, combining multiple methods of deriving the social vulnerability index (e.g., weighting techniques and GIScience model type) altered the magnitude and intensity of the index.
