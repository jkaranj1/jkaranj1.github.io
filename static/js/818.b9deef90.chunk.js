Joseph is currently researching spatially integrated social science that combines geographic information science (GIScience), vulnerability science, and health geography. Through his studies, Joseph aims to integrate spatial thinking principles in the identification of locations and populations that are most vulnerable. Geospatial methods are critical in vulnerability determination, thus it is important to intentionally assess how the implications of different GIScience principles influence the determination of vulnerability. When not immersed in research, Joseph enjoys playing computer games, hiking, or volunteering in mentorship programs and community service.
